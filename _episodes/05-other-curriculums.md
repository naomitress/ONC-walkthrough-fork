# Beyond Telemetry Reporting


OTN serves the telemetry and broader scientific community through its primary purpose, as a data aggregation node, but that is not where the community support ends.  In addition to curating and brokering interproject telemetry records, OTN has the following aspects:

## OBIS publishing

OTN is an OBIS thematic node, tasked with curating and coordinating the publishing of aquatic animal tracking data. OTN adheres closely to Darwin Core standards throughout the data reporting process.

## DOI minting

OTN creates DOI data sets when requested by researchers. These DOIs primarily support publications and descriptive links are held on the OTN members portal [publication data repository](https://members.oceantrack.org/data/pblctn_data).

## Study Halls

To reduce the stress of working in isolation, especially for early career researchers, OTN established a weekly 'Study Hall' session. Networking and collaborative problem solving in a virtual setting are hosted with a broad geographic attendance.

## Workshops
OTN has hosted many workshops in the past which contain different code sets relating to telemetry analysis.

- [OTN's Workshop Base Code](https://github.com/ocean-tracking-network/otn-workshop-base)
    - This is used to create custom workshops when requested.
