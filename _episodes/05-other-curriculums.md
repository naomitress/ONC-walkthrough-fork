### Beyond Telemetry Reporting

OTN serves the telemetry and scientific community through its primary purpose, as a data agregation node, but that is not where the community support ends.  In addition to collecting and dispersing telemetry records, OTN has the following aspects:

## OBIS publishing

## DOI minting

## Study Halls

## Workshops
OTN has hosted many workshops in the past which contain different code sets relating to telemetry analysis.

- [OTN's Workshop Base Code](https://github.com/ocean-tracking-network/otn-workshop-base)
    - This is used to create custom workshops when requested.
