This workshop will introduce learners to the concept of the MigraMar Database Node, including instructions for data submission and metadata template completion. Then, we will explore the R programming language, popular in the field of biologging.

In the R session we will explore some of the popular software packages suitable for exploring and plotting acoustic telemetry data, including `dplyr` and `ggplot2`, for the purpose of generating summaries for reports. 

While there are many compliucated analyses and R packages that can be used for acoustic telemetry, this workshop will only offer a brief introduction. An "advanced" curriculm is available upon request.
